## Game Production Plan

### Step One
* Create a new Ruby on Rails project
* Design, create and seed a database with information about users, flights, airports and how they're connected
* Design a user story and use that to set up the routes, controllors and views needed for the website
* Add the basic site layout to application.html.erb (navber, headings, etc.) and link it to a CSS stylesheet
* Commit initial version to GitHub and edit readme file

### Step Two
* Add general functionality related to the users (sign up, log in, edit details, sign out)
* Add general functionality related to the flights (view booked flights, search for flights, book flights, cancel flights)
* Add admin specific functionality (view user index, create flights, edit flights, delete flights)
* Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file

### Step Three
* Apply permissions (make sure that users need to be logged in to use the site and that admin-specific functionality is only accessible to admins)
* Style the website using CSS and Bootstrap
* Test the website as a potential user/admin to make sure everything works
* Deploy the website (if it hasn't been deployed already)
* Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file

### Step Four - bonus functionality
* Prevent users from massively overbooking a flight by including data about the plane and number of seats available
* Use the Google Maps API to estimate flight distances and therefore arrival times
* Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file

### Step Five
* Review and optimise code wherever possible
* Test the website as a potential user/admin to make sure everything (including bonus functionality) works
* Commit updated version to GitHub and edit readme file
